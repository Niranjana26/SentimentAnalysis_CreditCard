I guess it is an intentional move. Just to charge you an extra amount for failure of timely deposit. So for just buying things in advance you shouldn't go for a credit card like this.

Claimed security reasons with no explanation for denial and 24 hours wait to correct for correction. Well, still not functioning. Screwed out of hard earned cash.

Second u have to call a number where they transfer to hindi people where i can’t understand their accent. Third u can’t consolidate more that 25 dollars (from what they told me when i called). Fourth u have to wait 24-48 h to wait for the consolidation to take place (actually i did one and it’s being more than 48 h and still hasn’t taken place so if u need to transfer more than 25 dollars expect to wait about a week because u will have to do it in more than 1 transfer that can take 48h each.

So much for being careful, I think AmEx doesn't train its representatives well enough.

He said he will just take another order with the same customization and he made completely sure that he got the right address this time. And guess what, a couple of days later, I get this email from AmEx saying that the order was cancelled - no reasons mentioned. And, it was exactly the same order and I had used the same credit card to pay! When I called AmEx, they told me that no reason was mentioned on the system and that they would place a request to know the reason from their seniors and asked me to call me back after four to five days.",American-Express-Gift-Card
977,"By this time, I was completely furious. I told her that ""I am not going to this over and over again and if you cannot provide me a simple solution, I am just going to get it from another company."" But that did not bother her. She simply said that she cannot help. So without saying anything else, I hung up. Friends, after that I found giftcards.com that is far better than what AmEx offers. I was thinking why I didn't find this before and save me the trouble. They allow you to design custom gift cards and also a greeting card along with it with the photos(you can upload from your computer), wording and graphics of your choice. Trust me, DON'T go to AmEx for your gift card needs. They simply don't care! Save yourself the trouble!",American-Express-Gift-Card
978,"I waited for more than that and when I called, guess what again, they still have no answer! The representative's name was Tulsi and I still remember the way she handled my problem. Totally unprofessional and no eagerness at all to help me with a solution. I asked her about the refund to my first cancelled gift card. She told me to call them back when it is exactly 15 days and the tone she used was so demeaning. When I asked her to please be clear on why AmEx cancelled the order so that I could find out and place the order successfully this time, all she said was that the order was declined and there is nothing she could do to help except taking a new order.",American-Express-Gift-Card

Funny this is the IVR kept telling me that average wait time is 1 second:-). If you want to test your patience, just try them. Took at screen shot at 40 mins for referance.",SBI-Prime-Credit-Card

1385,"It is really annoying. I would expect such service to verify the information provided by the customers. Especially emails must be verified those days, because people always make mistake. I'm sick and tired of this business sending me documents belonging to someone else. Honestly. Enough.",SBI-Prime-Credit-Card
1386,"Please no one take sbi simply save credit card, they will call you from your bank and say recive maadikolli in your name, employes and they will not give you correct information, they will tell you that they will cut your annual fees for 1 year, dmart, fuel, hospital. bill, exetra tells you that you can use this card but does not tell you that you have to pay gst amount along with annual fees. Then at the end when they call you for confirmation call then they tell you that you have to pay gst along with annual fees. One of my experiences is that it has been only 1 and a half months since I received the credit card. In 1 and a half months, even though we have not used anything, annual fees+gst has been cut and 998rs minimum due amount endu has also been cut. It has been 1 and a half months since receiving. So please no one ever take sbi simply save credit card they will cheat you and after receiving the card you will get fraud call fake sms so check the call caal recive maadi, check the message and get correct information.

1387,"I had been using the card for more than 7 years and has been 100 percent regular on payment etc, however recently I missed a payment, the late payment fee charge was way too much. They impact my cibil and account was blocked, even after payment I had raise multiple times to activate it. I finally closed the account but still I get same bill again and again for same payment. They are not releasing noc as well and declined twice already saying technical error. The service is not at all acceptable and ethical for a 7 yr regular customer. Totally waste of time, money and energy",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1388,"After using my SBI credit card for 3 years, I had applied for cancellation of card. After initial reluctance, SBI finally cancelled my card. But Rs 589/- credit balance available in the card is not refunding inspite of repeated reminders. I approached to head customer service. But still this is unresolved for last one month without refund of money. Interaction ID 1-125236791199 and service reference No 1125705521220 were raised which are pending for long time.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1389,People should avoid using SBI card with such pathetic customer service.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1390,"I had been using SBI SimplySave Credit Card during past and experienced that service was not good. An annual fee was charged which was not informed while taking the card. Not only this, they charged interest on my due amount. This enforced me to block the card. A new card was provided by them without my knowledge and willingness and again I was charged money for the same.Though I didn't even use the card, the due amount was risen by the cheaters.I filed a complaint on SBI online site followed by no reply. Customer care services are also poor as an executive told me that he resolved the amount and closed the card. I thought that matter was resolved and third time too, I received messages for due amount. Finally, I lodged a complaint in the consumer court against them.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1391,"Keeping in mind, my long association with SBI for other financial services, I decided I would like to try out its credit card around 4 years back. After a lot of negotiations, they finally managed to allot me the SBI SimplySAVE Pro credit card. Let me talk about my experiences with the same as below.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1392,KEY FEATURES:,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1393,"I am aware of their other cards too. Personally, I don't think  ""Credit Cards"" is SBI's strong point, even though I like some of their other financial services. They always tend to be relatively less rewarding in this aspect.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1394,"5X rewards points: W.r.t. points accrual, it allows you 5X points accrual on any dining outlet, departmental stores and movie experiences. There are probably some reward points on joining too. The good thing is that the reward accrual was always there even on smaller dining outlets for every Rs. 125 spent. But the bad thing was you miss out on points even if you fall short by a small margin. Considering the rewards are itself 5X and not more, overall it doesn't seem like a good deal even though the point accrual is steady and continuous. On similar lines, the points accrual is also accounted for, in movie watching and departmental stores.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1395,"Fuel Surcharge Waiver: There is a provision of fuel surcharge waiver also for vehicle owners, although I didn't use it.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1396,"VISA Card / International Acceptance: The card is internationally accepted, which is not very unusual nowadays. Also, being a VISA card, it is widely accepted.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1397,"Annual Fee Waiver: This is where it scores over the basic SimplySAVE card. One has to spend Rs 30, 000 with this card in the previous year to get the annual fee of Rs. 500 waived. On the non-Pro version, Rs. 1, 00, 000 has to be spent to avail the same. Considering the very basic features, one wonders why isn't there any option of offering free to its loyal and longstanding customers.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1398,"WiFi Card: As is the norm with latest cards, WiFi is supported for transactions.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1399,"Online Card Transactions: It is supported, but is not as secure as many other cards. One gets that feeling with usage. Transaction can happen easily at times with this card.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1400,"Redemption on Products: This is another area where it scores low. It has a vast range of products to be redeemed with one's points. That's not bad,   but the redemption rates are so unrealistic or hefty, that one can only dream of reaching their goals, but not practically realise it. That's not a good scenario to complement the already somewhat gradual accrual of points.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1401,"If you are only looking to redeem a voucher, there too the rates are lowest, being Rs. 0.20 / point on most occasions (general).",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1402,"Maybe their aim is to ensure more card usage, but they should also understand why should anyone waste time using a non-productive card when there are so many more rewarding options? To put things into perspective, I only redeemed something 4 times in 4 years.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1403,Customer Service: This is ok. I did not observe anything great or bad in this regard.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1404,"Conclusion: To conclude, I was happy to get the burden of having this card off my back a few months back as one feels one has to use it when one has it. At the same time, one wonders, what is the point of using it with such low returns and working hard for basic things.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1405,"It is their ""Pro Card"", but neither SimplySAVE nor SimplySAVePro is likely to compare well with several other basic cards. I'm glad I no longer use it, even though I've had 2 instances of the card in the last 3.5 years.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1406,I have been using  SBI card from long but they are going backward and unprofessional when its come to Customer service on call.They just keep you wait until you get tired of waiting and cut the call .I have waited for 30min 25min and so on but didn't got any customer service executive to get in touch with me. I use Icici card as well and the best thing is they at least tell you exact time of wait and what's your waiting number so that you are aware for the delay. I haven't observe waiting for more that 5mins when I call ICICI or any other Bank service but SBI is just making me disappointed and if this continued ill leave this bank services for other and tell my friends to do so as well.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1407,I am using the SBI simple save card from last  year IN the beginning they charged me around 599 for the apply of the credit card and said that this card is now free for lifetime. In last year I use the card around 100000 rupees and paid timely payment always but they charge again annual fees of 499 . they said that you have to pay the amount it is compulsory.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1408,they also reduced the limit without any prior knowledge.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1409,there is no tracking system for this card how much I spend in previous time.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1410,Very bad service . I used many cards but this  card has a very bad service.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card

1412,"Request all of you, never apply for this card.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1413,As I have visited sbi bank for some issue at that time some worker has come near me and asked to take a credit card then after several days I have got credit card and I have used nearly 10000 rupees and after paying time they are taking interest of 5% which was just looting people. I have many banks credit card but sbi credit card was the worst experience in my life and when I contact about my issue to sbi bank they are saying that srry sir we cant do nothing and cant help you that is very strange so plz dont take credit card from sbi as it is your loss.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1414,"My card was renewed and sent to earlier address. This was despite my submitting documentary proof at the time of issue, and subsequent communication through internet portal of SBI cards through writing, and sending scanned documents through it and also updating by voice to an executive calling from Gurgaon. And yet, it was not effected! The reason given is I did not submit scanned documents in the time window. Whatever it means. But I had already communicated through several other channels several times. Why not take cognizance of that? Why rigidly stick to procedure and compelling me to re-initiate the whole procedure again? As a result, I did not receive the card and yet, the complaint system does not accept my complaint because I am using old card number. The card statement sent through e-mail also shows new card and hence deny me entry into the system. But I don't know new card number and the system does not accept my address updation despite sending many times. I feel like crying and am frustrated.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1415,From the day I have taken SBI credit card..none of my quieries have been cleared  because most of the service is sms or mail based...they have their predefined quieries list..from which one have to select their option..as my quieries was not listed there...I mailed them..but they always replied me itrelevent computerised answer which  did not clear my doubt...and the toll free number they provide have same problem.it also entertain to only predefined listed quiery and there is no option provided to talk to service executive directly..there is so much irregularities in their emi charging system....,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1416,The worst part of SBI is the customer service which can never be improved. I have been contacting them for last two days but after reaching to the last key(9) on phone IVR replies that the call can be monitored but no one talk from other side even I tried calling from 4 different numbers including landline.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1417,I had closed my relationship with them 3 years back due to the same reason and this time their team mentioned that now the service level has been improved but above incident proves they cannot change their approach as they believe they are the Govt. bank.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card

1421,I have taken this card as SBI credit card team was chasing me from last two years to take SBI credit card. In the past because of different statement provided by selling team and verification team I had declined to take the card after submitting the documents. After that also they reached out to me so many times and I decided to take this card as they will not disturb me again.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1422,"Team has mentioned there is no card fee at the time of selling the card, Now SBI has deducted Annual Fee charges from my credit card.",SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1423,SBI Credit card Team misguiding the people by providing wrong information,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1424,SBI credit card is very well for use transaction is  very fast and in this card change dollar into rupees is very fast and it is number 1 bank credit card of India you have to take it,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1425,I have been using the SBI simply save credit card for the last three years.  I am quite happy about the charges.  My annual fee is waived off for all the three years.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1426,I also availed big loan facility of Rs. 4 Lakhs and Rs. 1.72 lakhs.  I have cleared Rs. 4 Lakh loan.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1427,Quite satisfied about the charges.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1428,Few fraud transactions happened in dollars which r absolutely not done or not aware of them. Informed to customer care to remove them but they say without ur knowledge they won't happen & they never listened. I paid the amount for all the transactions done by me and did not pay fraud transactions. But they did not remove and keep on putting fines & late charges. They always call me on time to make payment but never ever care my complaint. Finally settled with them after paying amount which was not used by me. Literally they robbed my money. SO NEVER GO FOR Any SBI CREDIT CARD,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1429,The SBI creditcard is a trap where once you have entered it is impossible to come out . Worst customer care service and customer care donot have manners and parence to talk to their customers. Iam using SBI simply save card for last 3 year . Every year . I transact more thab 2 lakhs using sbi simply save card .,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1430,The SBI credit card  is a trap where once you have entered it is impossible to come out. I got this Simply Save SBI card 2 years back when a marketing executive approached informing it is lifelong free. After issuing the card the bank immediately put a joining fee. When I clarified they said it is one-time and afterwards there is no fee. Now after 2 years they have again put a annual fee+ GST to my card. This time it was totally unacceptable so I countered it and asked to reverse and close the card under interaction id(1-52121149149). The rude response came from SBI cards team including escalation team that first I should pay their imposed annual fee and then they will consider for cancellation request. Their customer care is worst and they want to take revenge to the customers by showing the outstanding based upon annual fee affecting the CIBIL rating. No other credit card issuing bank in India does this kind of highhandedness forcing customers to clear the annual fee and then only they would close the card. I am going to stay away form SBI card for entire life and I would advise everyone else to stay away too. There are other lifelong free credit cards with fantastic customer care and will not ruin your CIBIL rating by doing such malpractices. I really hate this kind of intimidation  form SBI card and would certainly stay away for peace of mind.,SBI-SimplySave-Credit-Card
1431,"This card doesn't deserve a rating of more than one star. Once you interact with the customer service, you will know. Purchasing the card is a one time activity and since a customer is paying he is treated very nicely by the bank. Once you pay and that is they make you run pillar to post. They dont respond to you or they lie to you after you email them more than 30 times and call them more than 10 times. You feel they might be mistaken. No what you don't realize is that it is a well orchestrated fraud where right from the Sales Team, Dispatch Team, Customer Care Team and Grievance Redressal Team know what part to play in the fraud. They try to bully you with their lies. You expose their fraud, then they try to cover up with fake back dated transactions. Too bad these guys haven't yet realized that in today's world its not easy to get away. I have raised a campaign againts them #GreatIndianFraud on twitter. Will make sure that they don't get away with it.",IndusInd-Visa-Credit-Card
1432,Customer care people not properly trained and they talk rudely with customers.,IndusInd-Visa-Credit-Card
1433,Sales and operation team always lie and they do false commitments.,IndusInd-Visa-Credit-Card
1434,"I have been using their credit card for past one year but when it came to redeem my rewards point i couldn't, when i call their team they first told me that I missed my due date few times that's why my card is temporarily blocked which was not true yet i thought they will activate in 48 hours, after 48 hours when i called their customer care team which normally takes 30 minutes to actually connect to a individual and he told me that my card is blocked for rewards redemption due to RE-KYC pending and i should mail my documents to them on mail, after mailing i called again after 48 hours and they told me it will take 5 more days.

Second u have to call a number where they transfer to hindi people where i can’t understand their accent. Third u can’t consolidate more that 25 dollars (from what they told me when i called). Fourth u have to wait 24-48 h to wait for the consolidation to take place (actually i did one and it’s being more than 48 h and still hasn’t taken place so if u need to transfer more than 25 dollars expect to wait about a week because u will have to do it in more than 1 transfer that can take 48h each.

I personally have used giftcards.com that allow you to get custom gift cards, VISA and others and I have been very satisfied with their service. Now, let me tell you about my experience with AmEx. First of all, they do not have a local US based customer service team(at least it seems so to me). So, I ordered a custom AmEx gift card on phone by calling the customer service.",American-Express-Gift-Card
2584,"The girl who took my order was Bella. Order #*. She seemed to have noted all my instructions very well but later when after the item having shipped on December 30, I had not received it even by January 7, I called them up to ask what was wrong and found out that the delivery was completely wrong and the package was being returned to American Express. So much for being careful, I think AmEx doesn't train its representatives well enough. I had ordered this for a friend who was getting married and thanks to fault on the customer representative, I could not get it on time and I had to request to cancel the order.",American-Express-Gift-Card
2585,"Although it had kind of already spoiled the fun by destroying the timing of the gift, I decided to place a reorder. And I did place another order #* this time too on the phone(I don't remember the representative's name). He said he will just take another order with the same customization and he made completely sure that he got the right address this time. And guess what, a couple of days later, I get this email from AmEx saying that the order was cancelled - no reasons mentioned. And, it was exactly the same order and I had used the same credit card to pay! When I called AmEx, they told me that no reason was mentioned on the system and that they would place a request to know the reason from their seniors and asked me to call me back after four to five days.",American-Express-Gift-Card
2586,"By this time, I was completely furious. I told her that ""I am not going to this over and over again and if you cannot provide me a simple solution, I am just going to get it from another company."" But that did not bother her. She simply said that she cannot help. So without saying anything else, I hung up. Friends, after that I found giftcards.com that is far better than what AmEx offers. I was thinking why I didn't find this before and save me the trouble. They allow you to design custom gift cards and also a greeting card along with it with the photos(you can upload from your computer), wording and graphics of your choice. Trust me, DON'T go to AmEx for your gift card needs. They simply don't care! Save yourself the trouble!",American-Express-Gift-Card
2587,"I waited for more than that and when I called, guess what again, they still have no answer! The representative's name was Tulsi and I still remember the way she handled my problem. Totally unprofessional and no eagerness at all to help me with a solution. I asked her about the refund to my first cancelled gift card. She told me to call them back when it is exactly 15 days and the tone she used was so demeaning. When I asked her to please be clear on why AmEx cancelled the order so that I could find out and place the order successfully this time, all she said was that the order was declined and there is nothing she could do to help except taking a new order.",American-Express-Gift-Card
